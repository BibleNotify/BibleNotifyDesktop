when Solomon had\

e came down from\
 heaven, and con\
sumed the burnt \
offering and the\
 sacrifices; and\
 the glory of Ya\
hweh filled the \
house.</p><p>7:2\
 And the priests\
 could not enter\
 into the house \
of Yahweh, becau\
se the glory of \
Yahweh had fille\
d Yahweh's house\
.</p><p>7:3 And \
when all the chi\
ldren of Israel \
saw how the fire\
 came down, and \
the glory of Yah\
weh upon the hou\
se, they bowed t\
hemselves with t\
heir faces to th\
e ground upon th\
e pavement, and \
worshipped, and \
praised Yahweh  \
saying, For he i\
s good; for his \
mercy endureth f\
or ever.</p><p>7\
:4 Then the king\
 and all the peo\
ple offered sacr\
ifices before Ya\
hweh. </p><p>7:5\
 And king Solomo\
n offered a sacr\
ifice of twenty \
and two thousand\
 oxen, and an hu\
ndred and twenty\
 thousand sheep:\
 so the king and\
 all the people \
dedicated the ho\
use of Elohim.</\
p><p>7:6 And the\
 priests waited \
on their offices\
: the Levites al\
so with instrume\
nts of musick of\
 Yahweh, which D\
avid the king ha\
d made to praise\
 Yahweh, because\
 his mercy endur\
eth for ever, wh\
en David praised\
 by their minist\
ry; and the prie\
sts sounded trum\
pets before them\
, and all Israel\
 stood.</p><p>7:\
7 Moreover Solom\
on hallowed the \
middle of the co\
urt that was bef\
ore the house of\
 Yahweh: for the\
re he offered bu\
rnt offerings, a\
nd the fat of th\
e peace offering\
s, because the b\
rasen altar whic\
h Solomon had ma\
de was not able \
to receive the b\
urnt offerings, \
and the meat off\
erings, and the \
fat.</p><p>7:8 A\
lso at the same \
time Solomon kep\
t the feast seve\
n days, and all \
Israel with him,\
 a very great co\
ngregation, from\
 the entering in\
 of Hamath unto \
the river of Egy\
pt.</p><p>7:9 An\
d in the eighth \
day they made a \
solemn assembly:\
 for they kept t\
he dedication of\
 the altar seven\
 days, and the f\
east seven days.\
</p><p>7:10 And \
on the three and\
 twentieth day o\
f the seventh mo\
nth he sent the \
people away into\
 their tents, gl\
ad and merry in \
heart for the go\
odness that Yahw\
eh had shewed un\
to David, and to\
 Solomon, and to\
 Israel his peop\
le.</p><p>7:11 T\

shed the house o\

e king's house: \
and all that cam\
e into Solomon's\
 heart to make i\
n the house of Y\
ahweh,  and in h\
is own house, he\
 prosperously ef\
fected.</p><p>7:\
12 And Yahweh ap\
peared to Solomo\
n by night, and \
said unto him, I\
 have heard thy \
prayer, and have\
 chosen this pla\
ce to myself for\
 an house of sac\
rifice.</p><p>7:\
13 If I shut up \

4 If my people, \

lves, and pray, \
and seek my face\
, and turn from \
their wicked way\
s; then will I h\
ear from heaven,\
 and will forgiv\
e their sin, and\
 will heal their\
 land.</p><p>7:1\
5 Now mine eyes \
shall be open, a\
nd mine ears att\
ent unto the pra\
yer that is made\
 in this place.<\

ow have I chosen\
 and sanctified \
this house, that\
 my name may be \
there for ever: \
and mine eyes an\
d mine heart sha\

etually.</p><p>7\

ather walked, an\
d do according t\
o all that I hav\

, and shalt obse\

n will I stablis\

thy kingdom, acc\
ording as I have\
 covenanted with\
 David thy fathe\
r, saying, There\
 shall not fail \
thee a man to be\
 ruler in Israel\
.</p><p>7:19 But\
 if ye turn away\
, and forsake my\
 statutes and my\
 commandments, w\
hich I have set \
before you, and \
shall go and ser\
ve other gods, a\

 I have sanctifi\
