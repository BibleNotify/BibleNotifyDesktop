Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p><p>6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</p><p>6:4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</p><p>6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p><p>6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</p><p>6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p><p>6:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p><p>6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p><p>6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</p><p>6:11 Give us this day our daily bread.</p><p>6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p><p>6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p><p>6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</p><p>6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p><p>6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p><p>6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</p><p>6:18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p><p>6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p><p>6:20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p><p>6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. </p><p>6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p><p>6:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p><p>6:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Elohim and mammon.</p><p>6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</p><p>6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p><p>6:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p><p>6:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p><p>6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p><p>6:30 Wherefore, if Elohim so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p><p>6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p><p>6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p><p>6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of Elohim, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p><p>6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>",       "chapter": "Matthew 6"     }  ] }
